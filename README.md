# Ek

> Ek (Sanskrit: एक, meaning "one" or "unity") 

Ek, a CLI tool that unifies Clojure project creation. One simple command to bring together the entire Clojure ecosystem.

## ✨ Why Ek?

Learning Clojure shouldn't start with decision paralysis. Which libraries to start with for a specific type of project? Ek aims to reduce time to start a new project for Clojure beginners.

### 🧩 Blueprint-Powered Templates
Unlike static templates, Ek uses **blueprints** - smart placeholders that adapt based on your project needs. You can choose to use an alternative to a library.

## 🚀 Quick Start (WIP)

## 🛣️ Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Templates (Current - Alpha)
- [x] Basic web application blueprints
- [x] CLI interface
- [ ] Data pipelines to build library and blueprint database

### Phase 2: Enhanced Blueprints
- [ ] Support enabling deployments
